# binner

binner is a simple Go CLI app that I wrote to deploy my own scripts or CLI apps to `/usr/local/bin`. I wrote a shell script to sort some files when I was organizing some SNES ROMS before copying them to my homebrewed Wii, and I copied the script to `/usr/local/bin` (and assign execute permissions) so that it was in my PATH and I could call it in my shell from any directory. I decided to create a simple tool for my self to do this.
